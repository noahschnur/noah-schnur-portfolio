      <p>
        I have recently completed a certificate from UC Berkeley Extension to become a full stack/MERN we developer. My background is in zookeeping, which while quite different has given me transferable skills such as working as part of a team, multitasking, completing projects on time, anticipating and adapting to issues, and solving complex problems, to name a few.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am looking for an opportunity to showcase my strong work ethic, my exacting attention to detail, strong communication skills, and to become a highly productive member of a team to help deliver outstanding results to an organization providing important products and services to its customers and the community.
